DESCRIPTION

The data was in a .xlsx file. It had 6 sheet files. Examples are: infected_per_day, recovered_per_day , cumulative_infected.

I cleaned and formatted these sheet files so they looked similar. I used jupyter notebook and Python.

I combined infected_per_day, recovered_per_day and deceased_per_day into hybrid.csv. The cumulative... sheet files formed cumulative.csv.

These csv files were imported to Rstudio for visualization. I created line graphs, lollipop plots, stacked area graphs and many others.

I posted my visualizations on LinkedIn, Twitter and Instagram, nan.viz.
